<h2>Plans for war</h2>
<h3>American</h3>
<p> Americans believed in power of air. Airfield was built on Luzon with a goal of targeting Japanese mainland. Aircarriers were  supported by Franklin administration, that viewed them as future of navy.</p>
<h3>Japanese
</h3>
<p>
Ratio of navy and army spending changed from 1940 from 73/27 to 60/40; Goal was to seize Dutch east resources to continue war with China. First phase was to take vital assets ( Philipiens, Malaya, Indies). Second was to take strategic islands in pacific ( Papue, Fiji, Samoa) to prevent allies from staging counter offesive. Japanese understand that Debellatio ( roman phrase for total destruction of enemy) wasnt possible. Also there was rivalry between Japanese army and navy. Quite often navy and army didnt agreed on operation. Army wanted to fight in China and Navy in pacific. For example Australian navy invasion was vetoed by army which have seen wast australia territories as demanding for manpower pool which was needed in China. Navy was futher disorganized into navy commanders who owned parts of navy and lending it to each other.
